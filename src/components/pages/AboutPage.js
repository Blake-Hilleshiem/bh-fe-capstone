          This webapp was made to highlight skills gained from DevPipeline's
          front-end course. The webApp should showcase the ability to setup
          navigation, route gaurd, fetch data, use input, and how to structure
          and organize applications.
        </p>
        <h2>My Take-Aways:</h2>
        <p>
          I'm grateful for the course that DevPipeline has put together. I'm
          sure had I tried to learn front-end on my own, I would've encountered
          a lot more confusion. Learning and being able to build and render to
          the browser is satisfying.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would say that my big take aways from the course have been think
          like a developer. Doing this both in visualizing how to structure the
          page and also in terms of how to make reusable code. Striving for that
          DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, I'd say repetition and my instructors suggestions/insights on
          how to clean up code have helped to solidfy the princples taught.
          There's a lot of information and nuances. The feedback and practice
          have impacted my confidence and how I face bugs/errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, I'd just say that programming is fun! There is a lot of cool
          things you can do. I'm excited to continue to learn more and add to
          this app.
